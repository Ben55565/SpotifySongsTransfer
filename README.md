# 🎵 Project Name: Spotify Playlister 🎶

🏴‍☠️ **Going from Pirate to Legit the Easy Way!** 🏴‍☠️

## Overview

🎵 Throughout my life, I've been enjoying songs either through YouTube or by downloading them. While it provided access to music, it was rather inconvenient, and I couldn't actively support the artists I love.

💡 Determined to make a change, I decided to transition to Spotify as my go-to music platform. However, faced with a collection of 2500 songs, the idea of manually creating a playlist seemed daunting. Then, it hit me—I'm a programmer! Why not leverage my skills to create a solution for this tedious task?

🚀 Introducing this automation project! My goal is to simplify the process of creating Spotify playlists by automatically adding my local music collection to new playlists. With this tool, I can now embrace Spotify fully, supporting the artists I admire and enjoying my favorite tracks guilt-free.


## How to Use

1. 🎶 Obtain your Spotify account details (username and password).
2. 📁 Organize your songs in a folder.
3. ▶️ Run the automation system.
4. 🎧 Sit back and enjoy as the system populates your new Spotify playlist with the songs from the folder.
